### Input process and output

Users of the "Cities App" React.js application can view and change data about some capital cities throughout the world. User interactions provide the computer with the names, nationalities, and demographic data required to add a new city to the database.

React.js components and the react-router-dom library are used by the application to process the input. An array of city objects, each holding data about a city's name, nation, and population, are kept in a state by the program. The application adds the new city object to the state when a user enters a new city through the "Add City" form. Routing is used by the application to switch between pages.

The viewer can view a list of cities, each of which has a link to a page with more information. The name, nation, and population of the city are displayed when you click on its name.
