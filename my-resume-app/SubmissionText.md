# Summary

We used Codespaces and React to build a client web app for the "MyResume" task. The objective was to display a resume that adhered to strict design guidelines. In order to present the resume material and apply personalized styling, we created two scripts, titled Resume.js and Resume.css. The primary App.js file then contained these imported files. Through this activity, we developed real-world skills in component organization, React web app development, and CSS style. Overall, it gave us an excellent way to present our knowledge, training, professional experience, and projects.
